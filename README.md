We're developing an application for those who struggle to communicate verbally, our app features real-time conversion of their actions, expressed in sign language, into voice. This enables seamless communication, eliminating hesitation for both sign language users and those unfamiliar with it. Our application fosters instant connection, allowing users to engage in meaningful conversations without language barriers.
Our project addresses the challenge of facilitating communication for individuals who face difficulties expressing themselves verbally. Many people, especially those proficient in sign language, encounter barriers in real-time conversations. This often leads to heightened feelings of depression and isolation. Our solution aims to bridge this communication gap by instantly converting sign language actions into voice in real-time. By doing so, we empower individuals to engage more freely with others, fostering inclusivity and breaking down language barriers that contribute to social hesitations and misunderstandings.
