# Mutalk
Mutalk is a video calling app designed for users who struggle with verbal communication. It instantly translates sign language into spoken words in real-time, making conversations seamless for both sign language users and those unfamiliar with it. Our goal is to promote inclusivity, reduce feelings of isolation, and foster meaningful connections by breaking down language barriers.

## Features
- Real-time Sign Language to Voice Translation: Mutalk is a video calling application that seamlessly converts sign language gestures into spoken words in real-time.Users can communicate effectively without language barriers, as their sign language actions are instantly translated into voice, enabling smooth conversations.

- Secure Authentication: Mutalk prioritizes user security with robust authentication mechanisms.
Through secure login procedures, users can trust that their conversations remain private and protected from unauthorized access.

- Support for Various Sign Language Models: Mutalk caters to diverse user needs by supporting multiple sign language models, including American Sign Language (ASL) and Indian Sign Language (ISL).Users can choose their preferred sign language model, ensuring accurate translation and enhancing accessibility for individuals from different linguistic backgrounds.

## Technologies Used

- Android Studio: The Android app is built using Android Studio, which provides a comprehensive integrated development environment (IDE) for Android application development.

- Firebase: Mutalk utilizes Firebase, a powerful and scalable platform provided by Google, for various backend services.

- Firebase Authentication: This service is used for user registration, login, and authentication, ensuring secure and seamless user verification.

- ZegoCloud: It revolutionizes virtual engagement with real-time interaction services for hassle-free cloud communication, connecting enterprises, teams, customers and users.

- Tensorflow: It is used to create a large-scale neural network with many layers. We have used for machine learning problems which is Image Classification.

- Colab: Colab allowed us to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning.

## Future of Mutalk

- Implementing a Paid Delivery Service: Introducing an option for organizations to offer paid delivery services for donated items would provide a convenient and reliable way to transport items from donors to NGOs or organizations. This feature would further streamline the donation process and increase the efficiency of delivering donated goods.

- Improving the Chatbot Experience: We plan to enhance our AI chatbot, CAREtaker, by giving it access to more data, including user data. This will enable the chatbot to provide more accurate and personalized insights, recommendations, and support to users. By leveraging user data, the chatbot can better understand user preferences and tailor its responses accordingly.

- Implementing Global Coverage: Expanding our app's reach to every country, state, and city would enable users from around the world to access and benefit from our platform. This global expansion would help us connect a larger audience with charitable causes and organizations, fostering a global community of donors.

- Language Translations: Adding language translation capabilities to our app would ensure that users from different linguistic backgrounds can easily navigate and interact with the platform. This feature would remove language barriers and make our solution more accessible and inclusive.

- Enhanced User Verification: Implementing a more robust user registration process, such as linking national identity verification, would help reduce fraud and spam donation ads. This additional layer of verification would ensure that the platform maintains a trusted environment for donors and organizations.

- Smart Categories that will give more personalized fields to be filled by the donor according to the category. For example, for food items, fields like expiry date, type. Size and gender for clothes, etc.

- Image Recognition: We can use machine learning to recognize the items that users are donating by analyzing the images uploaded by users. This can be done by using various image recognition APIs and libraries such as TensorFlow and Google Cloud Vision API. This can help in improving the accuracy of the donated item's category and description.

- Fraud Detection: Machine learning can be used to detect fraudulent donations by analyzing user behavior patterns and other data. By identifying and blocking fraudulent donations, we can ensure the transparency and authenticity of the platform.

- Natural Language Processing: We can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the user's descriptions of donated items better. This can help in categorizing and sorting items more accurately, improving the search feature, and enhancing the overall user experience.
